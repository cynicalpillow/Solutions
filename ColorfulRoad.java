  * Problem Statement
There is a one-dimensional road. The road is separated into N consecutive parts. The parts are numbered 0 through N-1, in order. Ciel is going to walk from part 0 to part N-1.
Ciel also noticed that each part of the road has a color: either red, green, or blue. Part 0 is red.
Ciel is going to perform a sequence of steps. Each step must lead in the positive direction. 
That is, if her current part is i, the next step will take her to one of the parts i+1 through N-1, inclusive. 
Her steps can be arbitrarily long. However, longer steps are harder: a step of length j costs j*j energy.
Additionally, Ciel wants to step on colors in a specific order: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, ... 
That is, she starts on the red part 0, makes a step to a green part, from there to a blue part, and so on, always repeating red, green, and blue in a cycle.
Note that the final part N-1 also has some color and thus Ciel must reach it in a corresponding step.
You are given a String road containing N elements. For each i, element i of road is the color of part i: 
'R' represents red, 'G' green, and 'B' blue. 
If Ciel can reach part N-1 in the way described above, return the smallest possible total cost of doing so. Otherwise, return -1.
